# 1.3.0
Full commit list since last stable release: https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/FFNx/compare/1.2.1...1.3.0

- Add support for Movies on FF8 Steam edition

**PLEASE NOTE:**
1. If you did use this driver in the past and you had to move files around, the game **will still work** but if you prefer to have a clean installation feel free to do so.
2. **Steam edition only:** Savegame files will still be read from the Game Installation directory and **NOT** from your Steam user profile directory.
