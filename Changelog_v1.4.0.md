# 1.4.0
Full commit list since last stable release: https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/FFNx/compare/1.3.1...1.4.0

- **NEW:** Support for Steam user data directories for both FF7 and FF8! You can continue to play where you left off, using the official driver.
- **ENHANCEMENT:** Smooth rendering on higher resolution. Enjoy beautiful upscaled gameplays.
- **ENHANCEMENT:** Re-organized configuration file. Now it is MUCH clearer which options belong to each game.
- **ENHANCEMENT:** Battle swirl in FF7 now behaves like in the official driver.
- **FIX:** Fix mixed 3D rendering and movie playback in some scenes, where 3D models were completely black.
- **FIX:** Fixed upscaled rendering where some green lines were appearing.
- **FIX:** Fixed debug font rendering, printing weird characters instead of alphanumerical characters, once the game was started in fullscreen mode.
- **MISC:** Removed DirectX 9 renderer. Basically broken and unreliable.
- **MISC:** Disable fancy_transparency by default. The option is now Opt-In by default.

**PLEASE NOTE:**
1. If you did use this driver in the past and you had to move files around, the game **will still work** but if you prefer to have a clean installation feel free to do so.
