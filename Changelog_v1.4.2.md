# 1.4.2
Full commit list since last stable release: https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/FFNx/compare/1.4.1...1.4.2

- **FIX:** Wrong disk detection for movies on FF8 Steam edition, defaulting always on disk 1. Now it will use the right disk.

**PLEASE NOTE:**
1. If you did use this driver in the past and you had to move files around, the game **will still work** but if you prefer to have a clean installation feel free to do so.
