**PLEASE NOTE:**
1. If you did use this driver in the past and you had to move files around, the game **will still work** but if you prefer to have a clean installation feel free to do so.
2. It is HIGHLY SUGGESTED to always use the given default config file. Using the old config will most probably end up in unexpected behaviors.
