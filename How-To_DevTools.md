# DevTools

If you're a modder and you want to test some of your changes faster than usually playing the game, this section may be of your interest.

FFNx brings a whole new game changer tooling that will allow you to explore more of the game engine, while playing everytime you prefer.

In order to use it, you must enable the relative flag on your [`FFNx.toml` config file](https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/FFNx/blob/master/misc/FFNx.toml#L259).

## Field Debug

This tool will allow you to jump from field to field. It is actually supported on both FF7 and FF8.

## World Debug

This will will allow you to futher investigate the World geometry and much more. Currently supported on FF8 only.
