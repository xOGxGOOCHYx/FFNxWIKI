## Audio Engine configuration

The new FFNx Audio Engine is completely configurable by you! Every audio layer can now have its own `config.toml` file, which through it you can customize the Audio Engine behavior when a track is going to be played.

The `config.toml` MUST BE within the relative configured `external_*_path` entry in the [FFNx.toml](misc/FFNx.toml) file.
For example, for the SFX layer on default configuration, the file should be placed in `sfx/config.toml`.

Feel free to check the example configuration included in each FFNx release.

### Audio Engine Layers

The current supported Audio Engine layers are:

- [SFX](misc/FFNx.SFX.toml): in-game audio sound effects ( menu cursor sound, battle sword slash sound, etc. )
- [Music](misc/FFNx.music.toml): in-game audio music ( world theme, field theme, etc. )
- Voice: in-game audio voice acting ( dialog voice acting )

## Music List

> Courtesy of [myst6re](https://github.com/myst6re)

Following below, you can find a list of file names that you can replace when using the external music layer, depending on the game you target.

Those filenames can be used directly within the relative Music folder and also within the Music TOML configuration file.
